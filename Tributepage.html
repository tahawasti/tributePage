        Arsène Charles Ernest Wenger OBE (French pronunciation: ​[aʁsɛn vɛŋɡɛʁ];
        born 22 October 1949) is a French football manager and former player. He
        was the manager of Arsenal from 1996 to 2018, where he was the
        longest-serving and most successful in the club's history. His
        contribution to English football through changes to scouting, players'
        training, and diet regimens revitalised Arsenal and aided the
        globalisation of the sport in the 21st century.

        Wenger was named manager of Arsenal in 1996, and two years later, he led
        the club to a Premier League and FA Cup double. The club won another
        league and cup double in 2002 and retained the FA Cup a year later. In
        2004, Wenger managed Arsenal to an undefeated domestic league season, a
        feat last accomplished by Preston North End, 115 years previously.
        Arsenal later eclipsed Nottingham Forest's record of 42 league matches
        unbeaten and went seven more matches before losing in October 2004. The
        club made their first appearance in a Champions League final in 2006,
        though they lost to Barcelona. After a period of almost nine years
        without a trophy, which coincided with the club relocating to the
        Emirates Stadium, Wenger guided Arsenal to further FA Cup success in
        2014, 2015 and 2017, before stepping down as manager a year later
        Shortly after his dismissal, Wenger travelled to the United Arab
        Emirates to attend a series of conferences held by FIFA.[70] Wenger was
        a member of the football governing body's technical committee,
        responsible for analysing the 1994 World Cup, and made a presentation to
        coaches of emerging football nations.[70] His speech was closely
        followed by Japanese delegates, whose country had invested millions into
        the restructuring of its football league system.[70] Representatives of
        Toyota, the majority owner of Nagoya Grampus Eight soon met with Wenger
        and offered him the chance to become the club's manager.[70] Wenger
        deliberated, even though the idea of working abroad appealed to him;
        negotiations between the two parties lasted for two months.[71] In that
        time, he sought the advice of his closest friends and family, and flew
        to Japan to watch Nagoya Grampus' striker Gary Lineker make his final
        appearance before his professional retirement.[72] In December 1994,
        Wenger agreed to become manager of Nagoya Grampus, on a two-year
        contract worth ¥75m annually.[73] Dragan Stojković flourished under
        Wenger's guidance at Nagoya Grampus. With the new season of the J.League
        commencing in March 1995, Wenger set about assembling his squad and
        backroom staff. He hired former Valenciennes manager Boro Primorac, whom
        he had befriended during the match-fixing scandal, as his assistant.[74]
        Alexandre Torres joined Nagoya after Wenger identified the defender by
        watching Brazilian football on the television, and the manager brought
        in Franck Durix and his former player Passi.[75] Nagoya finished bottom
        of the J.League the season before Wenger's arrival,[73] and continued
        their poor form into the following campaign, losing several matches in a
        row.[75] In response to the situation, Wenger altered his managerial
        style, becoming less amicable with his players and openly questioning
        their desire.[76] To boost morale, he took his squad to Versailles for
        their mid-season break, where they went through a rigorous, but
        creative, training regime.[77] Players were expected to make decisions
        for themselves on the pitch, instead of relying on the manager;[76]
        Wenger was reported to have shouted to his players "Don't look at me to
        ask me what to do with the ball!"[77] and "Decide for yourself! Why
        don't you think it out?"[78] One player who greatly benefited from
        Wenger's guidance was Dragan Stojković, a midfielder whose disciplinary
        record improved considerably.[79][80] Wenger's methods had the desired
        effect – Nagoya won 17 of their following 27 games to finish runners-up
        in 1995.[81] He shortly received the J. League Manager of the Year award
        for 1995, while Stojković claimed the player's honour.[82] In January
        1996, Wenger guided the club to their first piece of silverware as
        Nagoya defeated Sanfrecce Hiroshima to win the Emperor's Cup.[81] Two
        months later they triumphed in the Super Cup, beating Yokohama Marinos
        2–0.[83] The success bolstered Nagoya's status in Japanese football, as
        well as Wenger's reputation; he was somewhat startled by the praise and
        idolisation that came his way.
